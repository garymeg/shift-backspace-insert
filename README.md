# Shift+Backspace Insert

A simple VS Code extension that allows you to insert a space using **Shift+Backspace** when working in overtype mode, providing a convenient way to add spaces without switching back to insert mode.

## Features

- **Smart Space Insertion**: Press `Shift+Backspace` to insert a space at the cursor position
- **Overtype Mode Enhancement**: Particularly useful when working in overtype mode (Insert key toggle)
- **No Mode Switching**: Stay in overtype mode while inserting spaces as needed
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works in any file type and editor context within VS Code

### Use Case

When you're in overtype mode (activated by pressing the Insert key), typing normally replaces existing characters. This extension provides a quick way to insert spaces without having to:

1. Switch back to insert mode
2. Add the space
3. Switch back to overtype mode

Simply press `Shift+Backspace` to insert a space and continue typing in overtype mode.

## Installation

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "shift-backspace-insert"
4. Click Install

## Usage

1. Open any file in VS Code
2. Position your cursor where you want to insert a space
3. Press `Shift+Backspace`
4. A space will be inserted at the cursor position

**Note**: This works in both insert mode and overtype mode, but is particularly useful when in overtype mode.
